📦 Flipkart Sentiment Review Analysis
Analyze and classify customer reviews on Flipkart using Python, NLP, and machine learning to gain insights into customer sentiments and product performance.

📌 Project Overview
This project explores customer reviews from Flipkart with the aim of classifying sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP), data preprocessing, and machine learning techniques, we derive actionable insights that can enhance customer experience and inform e-commerce strategies.

🎯 Objectives
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on product reviews and ratings

Clean and preprocess textual review data

Implement sentiment classification using machine learning models

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score

Visualize insights using bar plots, word clouds, and heatmaps
